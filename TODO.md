# Error Fix: Cannot convert object to primitive value in User List

## Problem

- Runtime error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value" when accessing user lists page
- Error occurred in React component rendering, specifically in map functions and string conversions

## Root Cause

- User data fields (last_active, created_at, permissions) could be objects instead of expected types
- Implicit string conversion in JSX rendering caused the error
- Missing type validation in UserTable component

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated UserTable.tsx

- Added type validation for `user.last_active` field before formatting
- Now checks if `last_active` is string or Date instance before calling `formatDate()`
- Falls back to "[Invalid Value]" for invalid types

### 2. Simplified UserListPage.tsx Sanitization

- Removed complex sanitization that was changing User type structure
- Kept only essential sanitization for id, full_name, email, role, avatar_url, is_active
- Preserved original User type to maintain type safety

## Testing

- [ ] Test user list page loads without console errors
- [ ] Verify user data displays correctly with valid and invalid data
- [ ] Check pagination and user actions work properly
- [ ] Test with different user data scenarios (missing fields, invalid types)

## Follow-up

- Monitor for similar type conversion issues in other components
- Consider adding comprehensive data validation at API level
- Review other components that render user data for similar issues
