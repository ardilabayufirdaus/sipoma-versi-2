# API Proxy Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to implement the API proxy solution for mixed content issues on Vercel deployments.

## Files Created

1. **api/pb-proxy.js**
   - Serverless function to proxy requests from HTTPS to HTTP
   - Handles all HTTP methods, query parameters, and response types
   - Properly forwards headers and handles binary data

2. **components/ApiProxyTester.tsx**
   - Component to test the API proxy functionality
   - Allows testing health check and collections endpoints
   - Shows environment detection information

3. **pages/TestProxy.tsx**
   - Route to access the API Proxy Tester
   - Access at `/test-proxy` after deployment

4. **tests/api-proxy-test.js**
   - Test utilities for the API proxy
   - Functions to test GET, authentication, and file downloads

## Files Modified

1. **utils/pocketbase.ts**
   - Enhanced Vercel detection with both server-side and client-side checks
   - Updated `getPocketbaseUrl()` to use API proxy on Vercel deployments
   - Improved protocol handling and environment detection

2. **vercel.json**
   - Added specific route for API proxy
   - Added cache control headers for proxy requests
   - Ensured proper routing of all API requests

3. **MIXED_CONTENT_SOLUTION.md**
   - Updated with comprehensive documentation on the API proxy solution
   - Added code samples and explanations of how it works

4. **MIXED_CONTENT_UPDATE.md**
   - Updated with summary of the API proxy implementation
   - Added deployment instructions and testing guidance

## How It Works

1. **Environment Detection**
   - The application detects if it's running on Vercel using:
     - Server-side detection with process.env.VERCEL
     - Client-side detection with hostname checks

2. **URL Resolution**
   - On Vercel deployments: Uses `/api/pb-proxy` as the PocketBase URL
   - On other environments: Uses direct HTTP connection to PocketBase

3. **Request Handling**
   - All requests to `/api/pb-proxy/*` are routed to the serverless function
   - The function forwards the requests to the PocketBase server
   - Responses are returned to the client with appropriate headers

## Testing the Solution

1. **Local Testing**
   - Run the application locally
   - Access the test page at `/test-proxy`
   - Verify that direct connections work correctly

2. **Vercel Testing**
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Access the test page at `https://your-app.vercel.app/test-proxy`
   - Verify that proxy connections work correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**
   - Watch for any performance issues with the proxy
   - Be mindful of Vercel's serverless function limits

2. **Add Error Tracking**
   - Consider adding more detailed error logging
   - Set up alerts for proxy failures

3. **Consider SSL for PocketBase**
   - As a long-term solution, adding SSL to PocketBase would be ideal
   - Would eliminate the need for the proxy entirely
