# PocketBase Realtime Authentication Improvement Documentation

## Problem Description

The SIPOMA application was experiencing 403 Forbidden errors in PocketBase realtime connections with the error message: "The current and the previous request authorization don't match". This was causing realtime subscriptions to fail and affecting the overall application reliability.

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to handle authentication mismatch issues in PocketBase realtime connections through the following enhancements:

### 1. Realtime Connection Monitoring System

A dedicated `RealtimeMonitor` class has been implemented to:

- Track connection status and active subscriptions
- Detect and handle connection failures
- Implement periodic ping to verify connection health
- Automatically attempt reconnection with exponential backoff

```typescript
// utils/realtimeMonitor.ts
class RealtimeMonitor {
  // Connection state tracking
  private _isConnected: boolean = false;
  private _lastUpdate: Date | null = null;
  private _activeSubscriptions: Map<string, number> = new Map();

  // Methods to monitor and manage realtime connections
  public updateStatus(connected: boolean): void;
  public registerSubscription(collectionName: string): void;
  public unregisterSubscription(collectionName: string): void;
  public addListener(callback: (connected: boolean, lastUpdate: Date | null) => void): () => void;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced PocketBase Realtime Subscriptions

A wrapper around PocketBase's realtime subscription system has been created to:

- Add error handling to all subscriptions
- Track subscription status centrally
- Provide automatic recovery for failed subscriptions

```typescript
// utils/realtimeSubscription.ts
export const useRealtimeSubscription = <T = unknown>(
  collection: string,
  event: string = '*',
  callback: (data: T) => void
): (() => void) => {
  // Manages subscription lifecycle with error handling and reconnection
};
```

### 3. PocketBase Client Enhancement

The core PocketBase client has been enhanced with:

- Intercept 403 errors and trigger re-authentication
- Network status monitoring to detect online/offline states
- Synchronize authentication state across browser tabs

```typescript
// utils/enhancePocketbaseRealtime.ts
export function enhancePocketbaseRealtime(): void {
  // Override subscribe method with improved error handling
  pb.realtime.subscribe = function (...args) {
    try {
      const subscription = originalSubscribe.apply(this, args);
      realtimeMonitor.updateStatus(true);
      return subscription;
    } catch (err) {
      // Handle auth errors and trigger re-authentication
    }
  };

  // Add network connection monitoring
  window.addEventListener('online', () => {
    /* Handle connection restoration */
  });
  window.addEventListener('offline', () => {
    /* Handle connection loss */
  });
}
```

### 4. Connection Status Visibility

A new `RealtimeIndicator` component has been created to display the current connection status:

- Shows connected/disconnected state
- Displays last update timestamp
- Shows number of active subscriptions
- Visual pulse animation when data is updated

### 5. Usage in Application Components

Components can now use the enhanced subscription system:

```typescript
// Sample usage in a component
import { useRealtimeSubscription } from '../utils/realtimeSubscription';

function SomeComponent() {
  useRealtimeSubscription('collection_name', '*', (data) => {
    // Handle updated data
  });
}
```

## Testing and Verification

The implementation has been verified through:

- Successful build process with no errors related to the implementation
- Testing connection recovery under various network conditions

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the reliability of realtime connections in the SIPOMA application by:

- Automatically detecting and recovering from authentication mismatches
- Providing clear visibility into connection status
- Implementing robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Adding network stability detection and adaptive behavior

The system is now more resilient to network instability, authentication issues, and will automatically attempt to recover without requiring user intervention.
