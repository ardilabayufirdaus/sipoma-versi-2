## To Deploy and Test

1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. The mixed content detection should trigger automatically

## Long-term Solution

The most recommended permanent solution is to:

1. Add SSL/TLS to your PocketBase server (141.11.25.69:8090)
2. Update application to connect via HTTPS

This would eliminate the mixed content issue completely and provide the best security for your users.

Alternatively, implement the Vercel API proxy as described in MIXED_CONTENT_SOLUTION.md to work around the issue.
