# Mixed Content Solution Update - API Proxy Implementation

This document summarizes the updates made to address mixed content issues when accessing SIPOMA over HTTPS, particularly on Vercel deployments.

## Implemented API Proxy Solution

We've now implemented a complete API proxy solution that automatically handles mixed content issues on Vercel deployments:

1. **Serverless API Proxy**
   - Created `api/pb-proxy.js` serverless function
   - Transparently proxies all requests from HTTPS to HTTP backend
   - Handles all HTTP methods, query parameters, and binary responses

2. **Automatic Environment Detection**
   - Updated `utils/pocketbase.ts` to auto-detect Vercel deployments
   - Uses `/api/pb-proxy` path on Vercel
   - Falls back to direct HTTP connection on non-Vercel environments

3. **Vercel Configuration**
   - Configured `vercel.json` to handle API routes
   - Set up proper routing for API proxy requests

4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Added robust error handling in the proxy
   - Safely forwards headers and response data
   - Handles binary data and file downloads

5. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated MIXED_CONTENT_SOLUTION.md with API proxy implementation details
   - Added code samples and explanations

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **No User Action Required**
   - Users don't need to change any browser settings
   - No mixed content warnings displayed
   - Seamless experience regardless of environment

2. **Automatic Switching**
   - Local development still uses direct connections
   - Vercel deployments automatically use the API proxy
   - No code changes required when deploying

3. **Security Maintained**
   - All client-side traffic remains on HTTPS
   - API proxy provides controlled access to the HTTP backend
   - Properly handles authentication headers and tokens

## How to Test

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Access the application via HTTPS (https://your-app.vercel.app)
3. Verify that all API requests work without mixed content errors
4. Test login, data loading, and file uploads/downloads

## Future Improvements

While this solution solves the immediate problem, consider these long-term improvements:

1. **Add SSL/TLS to PocketBase Server**
   - Setting up HTTPS on your PocketBase server would be the most secure solution
   - Would eliminate the need for the proxy entirely

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor the performance of the API proxy
   - Be aware of Vercel's serverless function limits for high-traffic applications

3. **Caching Strategies**
   - Consider adding caching to reduce load on the proxy for frequently accessed data
